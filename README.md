# Demo Packer AAP

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to build custom machine images using HashiCorp Packer that include Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) components. The project automates the creation of pre-configured images with AAP dependencies, making it easier to deploy consistent Ansible environments across your infrastructure.

## What This Repository Does

- **Automated Image Building**: Uses Packer to create machine images with AAP pre-installed and configured
- **Secure Configuration**: Implements secure token handling for accessing private RedHat content
- **Reproducible Builds**: Ensures consistent AAP environments across different deployments

## Prerequisites

### Install packages

```bash
#Ensure latest packer is installed
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/packer
#ensure ansible is installed locally for packer provisioner
brew install ansible
```

### Tokens required

Follow [pre-reqs/README.md](./pre-reqs/README.md) to get all the IDs and tokens needed before running the Packer commands.

### Export environment variables

There are 2 methods you can use to handle the environment variables. You can export them as shown below:

```bash
export RHN_USERNAME="glennchia-hashi"
export RHN_PASSWORD="some_password"
export RHSM_ALLOCATION_UUID="7f4075b9-38ac-46e3-986d-bf481d1853be" #subscription allocation uuid https://access.redhat.com/management/subscription_allocations
export RHSM_OFFLINE_TOKEN="some_offline_token" #subscription offline token https://access.redhat.com/management/api expires with 30 days inactivity
export RHN_REGISTRY_SVC="16723312|svc-registry" #registry service account https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/
export RHN_REGISTRY_TOKEN="ey---------"
export AAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD="Hashi123!" #Ansible Automation Platform admin password. Set your own password.
export HUB_OFFLINE_TOKEN="ey..." #Automation Hub offline token https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token
```

Or you can set them in a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following. This file is automatically loaded by the Makefile when running targets like make aap_demo.

```ini
# .env.local
RHN_USERNAME="glennchia-hashi"
RHN_PASSWORD="some_password"
RHSM_ALLOCATION_UUID="7f4075b9-38ac-46e3-986d-bf481d1853be"
RHSM_OFFLINE_TOKEN="some_offline_token"
RHN_REGISTRY_SVC="16723312|svc-registry"
RHN_REGISTRY_TOKEN="ey---------"
AAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD="Hashi123!"
HUB_OFFLINE_TOKEN="your-access-token-here" # e.g. "ey...."
```

ðŸ”’ Make sure .env.local is listed in .gitignore to avoid committing sensitive credentials.

### Create ansible.cfg file

An `ansible.cfg` file is required in the root directory for installing supported AAP collections from Red Hat Automation Hub. Replace `<HUB_TOKEN>` below with teh value of `HUB_OFFLINE_TOKEN` that is retrieved in the previous step.

> [!NOTE]
> To access private content from Red Hat Automation Hub via `ansible-galaxy`, a token is required. This token is used in `ansible.cfg` but should **never be committed to source control**.

```
[galaxy]
server_list = hub
ignore_certs = yes

[galaxy_server.hub]
url=https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/content/published/
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
token=<HUB_TOKEN>
```

### Set AWS credentials

If you're using doormat, run:

```bash
doormat login -f && eval $(doormat aws export --account ${DOORMAT_AWS_USER})
```

Alternatively set AWS credentials in your environment

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=example
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=example
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=example
```

## Build AAP image

This repository comes with a [Makefile](./Makefile) that helps with the installs. Run the following to build the AAP base image:

```bash
make aap_demo
```
